# Challenge: Regression
Problem:  
Use several machine learning methods to create regression models valuing real estate. Where appropriate generate new attributes in an effort to improve model accuracy.

Setup Notes:  
Open the .ipython file with Jupyter Notebook, a python3 kernel is needed to run the scripts.
These notebooks use scikit-learn's GradientBoostedRegressor and RandomForestRegressor methods.

Questions and Comments:  
If you find the scripts useful, let me know: myopicvisage@gmail.com. Or if you would like to contribute, I would be happy to have assistance in feature elimination, optimization, and graphics.
