# Regression-Challenge
Problem: 
Min(MSE) by using several Machine learning methods and generation of new attributes.

Setup Notes:
Open the .ipython file with Jupyter Notebook, a python3.4 kernel is needed to run the scripts.
These notebooks use scikit-learn's GradientBoostedRegressor and RandomForestRegressor methods.

Questions and Comments:
If you find the scripts useful, let me know: myopicvisage@gmail.com. Or if you would like to contribute, I would be happy to have assistance in feature elimination, optimization, and graphics.
